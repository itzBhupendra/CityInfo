Questions for task and async 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here are some focused questions on Task and async in .NET, which are essential concepts for handling asynchronous programming efficiently:

Task and async Interview Questions
What is the purpose of Task in .NET, and how is it different from Thread?

Discuss how Task is a higher-level abstraction that manages threads in a pool, whereas Thread represents a single thread in the operating system.
Explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming. Why is async programming beneficial?

Highlight that async programming enables better responsiveness, especially in I/O-bound operations, by freeing up the main thread while waiting.
How does the async and await keywords work together in C#?

Explain that async marks a method as asynchronous, while await is used to asynchronously wait for a Task to complete, returning control to the caller.
What is the Task.Run method, and when should it be used?

Describe how Task.Run is typically used to offload CPU-bound work to a separate thread, and discuss scenarios where it is or isn't necessary.
Explain the difference between Task, Task<T>, and ValueTask.

Discuss when each is used: Task for non-returning asynchronous methods, Task<T> for returning a result, and ValueTask for performance optimization, particularly in cases of frequently completed tasks.
What is the purpose of ConfigureAwait(false), and when should it be used?

Explain how ConfigureAwait(false) tells the Task not to capture the current synchronization context, which improves performance in library code that doesn’t need to resume on the original context.
How can you handle exceptions in asynchronous code?

Describe how to use try-catch blocks in async methods, handling AggregateException in Task, and how await automatically unwraps exceptions for simpler handling.
What is the difference between Task.Wait() and await Task?

Explain that Task.Wait() is blocking and waits on the main thread, while await is non-blocking and allows other work to proceed until the task completes.
Describe async void and why it should generally be avoided.

Mention that async void is used for event handlers but should generally be avoided for other tasks since it doesn't return a Task, making error handling and chaining difficult.
What is Task.WhenAll and Task.WhenAny, and when would you use them?

Explain how Task.WhenAll waits for multiple tasks to complete, while Task.WhenAny waits for the first task to complete, and provide scenarios for concurrent task execution.
How can you cancel an asynchronous operation in .NET?

Describe how CancellationToken and CancellationTokenSource are used to signal cancellation and how to implement responsive cancellation in async code.
How does async programming affect the performance of ASP.NET applications?

Discuss how async programming frees up threads to handle more requests by releasing resources while waiting, thereby improving scalability.
Explain the async/await state machine and how it works under the hood.

Detail that the compiler translates async methods into a state machine, which allows for saving the current state and resuming from where it left off.
What is deadlock in async code, and how can it occur?

Explain how deadlocks can occur, especially when using Wait or Result instead of await on the main thread, and strategies to prevent them, like ConfigureAwait(false).
Can you give an example of when ValueTask is preferred over Task?

Discuss scenarios with frequent calls or high-performance applications where ValueTask reduces allocations, but also explain the trade-offs and limitations.
