1. Client Application on Desktop:
The client application running on desktop devices serves as the primary interface for end-users to interact with the system.
It communicates with the backend services to perform various operations such as data retrieval, updates, and processing.
2. Existing Services and Batch Jobs on App Server:
The application server hosts existing services and batch jobs that perform backend processing and data manipulation tasks.
These services may include legacy components or custom applications responsible for specific business logic or data processing.
Batch jobs are scheduled tasks that run at specified intervals to perform automated data processing, reporting, or maintenance tasks.
3. IIS Web Farm Services:
The IIS web farm consists of multiple servers running Internet Information Services (IIS) to host web applications and services.
These servers host services such as the Business API, Letter Service, Mainframe Service, DoC Service, and DAL Service.
Each service exposes endpoints for performing specific operations and interacts with the client application and other backend components.
4. Database Server:
The database server stores and manages persistent data used by the system.
It hosts one or more databases that store application data, configuration settings, and transaction logs.
The database server is accessed by backend services and batch jobs to read and write data, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
5. Communication and Integration:
Communication between components occurs via HTTP(S) protocols for client-server interactions and inter-service communication.
The client application communicates with the backend services through RESTful APIs or other communication protocols.
Integration between existing services, batch jobs, and IIS web farm services may involve message queues, file transfers, or direct database access.
6. Security and Access Control:
Security measures such as authentication, authorization, and data encryption are implemented to protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication.
Access control mechanisms restrict access to resources based on user roles and permissions, preventing unauthorized access to confidential information.
7. Logging and Monitoring:
Logging mechanisms capture events, errors, and performance metrics from all components, providing visibility into system behavior and troubleshooting capabilities.
Monitoring tools track system health, performance metrics, and resource utilization, allowing proactive management and optimization of the system.
8. Scalability and Redundancy:
The architecture is designed for scalability, allowing additional servers to be added to the IIS web farm or application server cluster to handle increased load.
Redundancy and failover mechanisms ensure high availability and fault tolerance, minimizing downtime and service disruptions.
9. Conclusion:
The high-level architecture provides a robust and scalable platform for delivering services to end-users while ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.
By leveraging desktop client applications, existing services, IIS web farm services, and database servers, the system can efficiently handle diverse workloads and meet the needs of the organization.
